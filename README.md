E-commerce Customer & Sales Analysis


📌 Project Overview

•This project focuses on analyzing E-commerce Customer and Sales Data using SQL.
•The main objective is to generate meaningful insights from customer purchase behavior and sales performance to support data-driven business decisions.




📊 Key Objectives

•Analyze overall sales and profit trends

•Identify top-performing product categories and sub-categories

•Track customer behavior (repeat purchases, order value, frequency)

•Compare actual sales with sales targets

•Provide category-wise and time-based performance insights




🗂️ Database Schema

•The project works with the following tables (sample structure):

•Customers → Customer details (ID, Name, Region, Segment)

•Orders → Order ID, Order Date, Customer ID, Ship Mode

•Order_Details → Product ID, Product Name, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Quantity, Profit

•Sales_Target → Category/Sub-Category target sales




🛠️ SQL Analysis Tasks

•Calculate total sales, profit, and number of orders

•Find month-wise and year-wise sales trends

•Identify best and worst performing product categories

•Compare sales vs. targets for each category

•Analyze customer retention and average order value (AOV)

•Use SQL JOINS, CTEs, Subqueries, and Window Functions for deeper insights





🧑‍💻 Tools & Technologies

•SQL (MySQL / SQL Server / PostgreSQL)

•Excel / Power BI / Tableau (optional for visualization)

•SQL Client or Workbench





🚀 How to Run the Project

•Clone the repository

•git clone https:https://github.com/MaheshTechPro-hash/SQL-project/blob/main/E-commerce%20Customer%20%26%20Sales%20Analysis

•Import the database schema (DDL) into your SQL environment

•Load the dataset (CSV or SQL dump)

•Run SQL queries step by step to generate outputs

•(Optional) Export results to Excel or a BI tool for visualization






📈 Expected Insights

•Sales growth/decline patterns across months and years

•Category and sub-category profitability

•Customer segmentation and purchasing habits

•Gap analysis: actual sales vs. target sales





🔮 Future Enhancements

•Build interactive dashboards using Power BI / Tableau

•Apply RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for customer segmentation

•Implement Forecasting Models to predict future sales

•Extend project for Machine Learning based recommendation systems
