E-commerce Customer & Sales Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing E-commerce Customer and Sales Data using SQL.
The main objective is to generate meaningful insights from customer purchase behavior and sales performance to support data-driven business decisions.

📊 Key Objectives

Analyze overall sales and profit trends

Identify top-performing product categories and sub-categories

Track customer behavior (repeat purchases, order value, frequency)

Compare actual sales with sales targets

Provide category-wise and time-based performance insights

🗂️ Database Schema

The project works with the following tables (sample structure):

Customers → Customer details (ID, Name, Region, Segment)

Orders → Order ID, Order Date, Customer ID, Ship Mode

Order_Details → Product ID, Product Name, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Quantity, Profit

Sales_Target → Category/Sub-Category target sales

🛠️ SQL Analysis Tasks

Calculate total sales, profit, and number of orders

Find month-wise and year-wise sales trends

Identify best and worst performing product categories

Compare sales vs. targets for each category

Analyze customer retention and average order value (AOV)

Use SQL JOINS, CTEs, Subqueries, and Window Functions for deeper insights

🧑‍💻 Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL / SQL Server / PostgreSQL)

Excel / Power BI / Tableau (optional for visualization)

SQL Client or Workbench
